# Number-Recognition

I wrote a python script using the OpenCV framework to detect digits from the data set

How does it work?

The code works simply as two parts. The aim of the first part is to train the script with possible images. Once the training is done, you can test your scanned image

To open the project kindly switch the branch to "master"
